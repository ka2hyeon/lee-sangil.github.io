In Spring 2015, I joined <a href="http://icsl.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">ICSL</a> in Seoul National University to pursue research in **Robotics**. I am currently working with <a href="http://pyojinkim.me/" target="_blank">Pyojin Kim</a>, <a href="http://blog.naver.com/rlackd93/" target="_blank">Changhyeon Kim</a>, and Haram Kim.

[comment]: <> (### developing artificial 3D perception)

My research interests in robotics are in **3D Vision** ( Visual Odometry[[1], [2], [3]] and Robust Visual Odometry[[1]] ) and **2D Vision** [[4]).
