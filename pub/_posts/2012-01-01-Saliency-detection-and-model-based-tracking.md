Towards the goal of fast, vision-based autonomous flight, localization, and map
building to support local planning and control in unstructured outdoor
environments, we present a method for incrementally building a map of salient
tree trunks while simultaneously estimating the trajectory of a quadrotor
flying through a forest. We make significant progress in a class of visual
perception methods that produce low-dimensional, geometric information that is
ideal for planning and navigation on aerial robots, while directing
computational resources using motion saliency, which selects objects that are
important to navigation and planning. By low-dimensional geometric information,
we mean coarse geometric primitives, which for the purposes of motion planning
and navigation are suitable proxies for real-world objects. Additionally, we
develop a method for summarizing past image measurements that avoids expensive
computations on a history of images while maintaining the key non-linearities
that make full map and trajectory smoothing possible. We demonstrate results
with data from a small, commercially-available quad-rotor flying in a
challenging, forested environment.
