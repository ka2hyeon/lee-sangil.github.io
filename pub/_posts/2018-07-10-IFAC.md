Exploring an unknown environment with multiple robots is an enabling technology
for many useful applications. This paper investigates decentralized motion planning for multi-
agent exploration in a  eld with unknown received signal strength (RSS) distribution. The
environment is modelled with a Gaussian process using Bayesian online learning by sharing the
information obtained from the measurement history of each robot. Then we use the mean
function of the Gaussian process to infer the multiple RSS source locations. The inferred
source locations are modelled as the probability distribution using Gaussian mixture-probability
hypothesis density (GM-PHD)  lter. This modelling enables nonparametric approximation
of mutual information between source locations and future robot positions. We combine the
variance function of the Gaussian process and the mutual information to design an informative
and noise-robust planning algorithm for multiple robots. The experimental performance is
analyzed by comparing with the variance-based planning algorithm.
